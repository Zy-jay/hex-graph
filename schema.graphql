# Design:
# 1. Use BigInt for all number fields. This makes it easy to handle in ethers.js or other web3
#    frontend libraries. This ensures long term data consistency and interoperability.
# 2. Return values as would be returned by the contract. Do not convert them to human
#    readable form within the subgraph. It is the frontends job to hanlde this conversion.

# Rules:
# 1. Don't break ABI. Application's will be built using this subgraph for various purposes.
#    We do not want updates to this subgraph to trash multiple apps at once. If for some reason
#    an ABI breaking change has to be made, all known consumers of this subgraph must be notified
#    at least 30 days in advance.
# 2. Additions must be peer reviewed. We must ensure all additions to this subgraph thouroughly
#    serve their intended purpose, as not to be forced to break rule #1 later.
# 3. No scams allowed. If you want your contract to be part of this subgraph you must submit
#    contract for review to https://t.me/pulsepolice and pass a peer review.
